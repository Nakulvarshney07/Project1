        <div class="content">DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies,
            practices, and tools that increases an organization’s
            ability <br>to deliver applications and services at high velocity:
            evolving and improving products at a faster pace than <br> organizations 
            using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
            This speed <br>enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.</div>

        <div class="content">
            Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams<br> are merged 
            into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development<br> and test to
             deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.<br><br><br>
             In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with
              development<br> and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of
               everyone on a DevOps team, this is<br> sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.<br><br><br>
               These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology
                stack<br> and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help 
                engineers independently<br> accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally
                 would have required help from other <br>teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

            <div class="know">Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster,
                 adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient<br> at driving business results. 
                 The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results.
                  For<br> example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services
                   and then release updates to them quicker.</div></div></div>

            <div class="know">Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve
                 your product faster. The quicker you can<br> release new features and fix bugs, the faster you
                  can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage.<br> Continuous integration 
                  and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build
                   to deploy.</div></div></div>

                 reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while<br> maintaining a positive experience for end users.
                  Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test<br> that each change is
                   functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.

                  infrastructure as code helps you<br> manage your development, testing, and production environments in a 
                  repeatable and more efficient manner.</div></div></div>

                ownership and accountability.<br> Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, 
                and combine their workflows. This <br>reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between
                 developers and operations, writing code that <br>takes into account the environment in which it is run).</div></div></div>

            <div class="know">Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without

                  techniques. For<br> example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at
                   scale.</div></div></div>
