            <div class="content">Cloud services
                 is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet
                  with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and 
                  maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access 
                  technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases,</div>
            <div class="high">Who is using cloud computing?</div>
            <div class="content">
                Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for
                 a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email,
                  virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and 
                  customer-facing web applications.<br>
                  For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized 
                  treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power
                   real-time fraud detection and prevention.

                    Agility</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. </li>
                    <li>You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before.</li>
                </ul></div>
                <div class="inner2"><h2>Elasticity</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future.<br> Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need.</li>
                    <li>You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.</li>
                </ul></div>
                <div class="inner3"><h2>Cost savings</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it.</li>
                    <li> the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. </li>
                </ul></div>            
                <div class="inner4"><h2>Deploy globally in minutes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.</li>
                    <li> Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience. </li>

            <div class="know">IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. 
                It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual
                 or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the 
                 highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

            <div class="text"><h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
            <div class="know">PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying
                 infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows 
                 you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
                  This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource
                   procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching,  </div></div></div>

            <div class="text"><h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
            <div class="know">SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and
                 managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS
                  are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a
                   SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained
                    or how the underlying infrastructure is managed.
