               <div class="content">Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the use of software “robots” 
                (i.e., specialized computer programs) to standardize and automate repeatable business processes.
                 RPA robots perform the same way every time. They don't learn from one repetition to another, and
                  they will not improvise or come up with a better way of doing their programmed task.</div>

        <h3 class="botto"> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems, or “machines.” These processes 
        include learning (acquiring information and contextual rules for using the information), reasoning (using context and rules to
         reach conclusions) and self-correction (learning from successes and failures). AI capabilities are endless, popular applications 
         include image recognition, machine vision, speech recognition, chatbots, natural language generation, and sentiment analysis.</h3>
